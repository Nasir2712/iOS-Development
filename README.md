# iOS-Development
Some of my projects that i have worked on last year. I wanted to try something new and iOS development was so interesting especially learning Swift 2.0.

Instagram Clone - This application is made using Swift 2.0 and Parse. This application is a clone of instagram where a user can add in images, follow and unfollow other users. The user can also upload images and view other users posts on its newsfeed.

Memorable Places- This application is made when i was learning more and more about MapKit Frameworks in Swift 2.0. It remembers all the places that has been marked with the pin. A user can save all his favourite memorable locations names in a list and also their co-ordinates in the map

Stop-Watch - A simple stop watch application

Tic-Tac-Toe - A infamous tic tac toe game application

To-do-List - A to-do-list application

Whats-the-Weather - A weather application which takes all the information from a weather forecast website and displays all the information in the app.
